# ProfApps
in this project is to find profitable mobile app profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets. We work as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to empower our developer team to make data-driven decisions about the type of apps they create.   we only create applications that can be downloaded and installed for free, and our main source of income consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any app is mostly affected by the number of users who use our app. Our goal with this project is to analyze the data to help our developers understand what types of applications are likely to attract more users.
